Moving from civil engineering to the dynamic realm of the tech industry, I embarked on a transformative journey culminating in a STEM degree specializing in business analytics, right here in San Francisco. 
Armed with six years of invaluable experience in engineering and project management, I've recently acquired a rich skill set encompassing data analysis, machine learning, and cutting-edge technologies. 
My goal? To seamlessly blend my seasoned expertise with these newfound capabilities, aiding startups and established enterprises alike in navigating the burgeoning AI revolution. ðŸš€
