Hi, I’m Sophie! I've recently moved from Montreal to San Francisco to pursue a master’s in business analytics. I’m a sustainability nerd, focused on data-driven solutions for sustainability that make sense for the community, the environment, and business.

My past experience in management has strengthened my belief that innovative business models are a solution for systemic change and the future success of our planet. Using tools such as Python, R, SQL and Tableau, I believe we can mine the ever-growing data world to find deep insights and solutions for our present challenges.
