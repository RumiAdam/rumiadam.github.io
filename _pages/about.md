Hi, I’m Sophie! 

I'm a globe-trotter who has recently moved from Montreal to San Francisco to pursue a master’s in business analytics. Now currently living in Switzerland. I’m a **sustainability nerd**, focused on data-driven solutions for sustainability that make sense for the community, the environment, and business.

My past experience in management has strengthened my belief that innovative business models are a solution for systemic change and the future success of our planet. Using tools such as Python, R, SQL and Tableau to mine data, I believe we can find deep insights and solutions for our present challenges.

I was born and raised in São Paulo (in case you were wondering which city was the panorama above), and I'm passionate about the globe, fascinated by cities, and curious about all types of food.
